# solidity-testing-practice
Practice repository for learning Solidity smart contract testing using Foundry.  Includes beginner to advanced examples: functions, events, mappings, modifiers, ether handling, and gas optimization.


Topic 1: Functions & State Variables

Counter contract banao â†’ set, get, increment aur decrement function likho.

Simple Bank contract banao â†’ ek variable me balance store karo aur deposit/withdraw function likho.

Calculator contract banao â†’ add, subtract, multiply aur divide functions likho.

String storage contract banao â†’ name set karo aur get karo.

Boolean flag contract banao â†’ toggle() function se true/false switch ho.
 
Topic 2: Arrays & Structs

Todo List contract â†’ addTask, toggleTask, deleteTask, getAllTasks.

Student Record contract â†’ struct {name, age}, addStudent, getStudent, updateStudent.

Dynamic array contract â†’ numbers array me push karo aur remove karo.

Voting contract â†’ struct Candidate, vote count track karo.

ShoppingList contract â†’ struct {itemName, price}, add item, delete item, get items.


Topic 3: Mappings

Wallet mapping contract â†’ mapping(address => uint balance), deposit aur withdraw.

Voting contract â†’ mapping(address => bool voted), ensure voter sirf ek baar vote kar sake.

Grades contract â†’ mapping(string => uint marks), student ka naam â†’ marks.

Simple Token contract â†’ mapping(address => uint balance), mint aur transfer.

Allowance contract â†’ mapping(address => mapping(address => uint allowance)), approve aur transferFrom jaisa.


Topic 4: Events

Todo contract â†’ TaskAdded event emit karo jab naya task add ho.

Bank contract â†’ Deposit aur Withdraw events emit karo.

Token contract â†’ Transfer event emit karo.

Auction contract â†’ NewBid event emit karo jab koi bid kare.

Ownership contract â†’ OwnershipTransferred event emit karo jab owner badle.

ðŸŸ£ Topic 5: Modifiers & Access Control

Ownable contract â†’ sirf owner hi special function call kar sake.

Voting contract â†’ sirf admin hi voting start/stop kar sake.

Token contract â†’ sirf owner hi mint kar sake.

Bank contract â†’ sirf account owner hi withdraw kar sake.

Student Record contract â†’ sirf teacher hi marks update kar sake.


Topic 6: Ether Handling

Payable contract â†’ receive function se ETH accept karo aur balance check karo.

Withdrawal contract â†’ owner apna balance nikal sake.

Donation contract â†’ har donation store karo aur total donation count karo.

SplitPayment contract â†’ ek function jo ETH ko do addresses me equally split kare.

Simple Lottery contract â†’ users entry fee de aur owner winner select kare.


Topic 7: Advanced (Inheritance, Interfaces, Libraries)

Inheritance contract â†’ Base me ek function, Child usse inherit karke override kare.

Interface contract â†’ ERC20 interface ka ek chhota version implement karo.

Library contract â†’ Math library banao jo square aur cube calculate kare.

Abstract contract â†’ ek abstract contract banao aur child me usko implement karo.

Upgradeable contract (simple) â†’ proxy ka use karke state preserve karo aur logic update karo.
